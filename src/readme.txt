From now, when a new order has been successfully paid or you have accepted the payment, the order data will automatically be imported into your Packlink PRO account, so that Packlink PRO is always updated with all orders that are ready for shipment in WooCommerce. You can also manually import each order separately. To ship these orders, go to Packlink PRO, where you will be able to see all your orders in the list of shipments. For each order, you will need to select the shipping service.
